Hi! I'm Sumeet, an ML Researcher studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I'm working on Multiagent Systems, Security, Reward Learning, and Foundation Model Safety.

My current research focus is on Language Agents at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence and on Agentic Collusion with research groups in the UK. Previously, I've done internships/residencies at Redwood Research, Solana Labs, Convergent Finance, and GEn1E Lifesciences.

This website is under construction.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
